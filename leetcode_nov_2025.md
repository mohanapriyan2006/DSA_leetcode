# 2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unguarded-cells-in-the-grid/description)
 
Medium
 
You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.

A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.

Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

 

Example 1:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/example1drawio2.png)

Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]

Output: 7

Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.


Example 2:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/example2drawio.png)

Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]

Output: 4

Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 105
2 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 104
2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n
guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2
0 <= rowi, rowj < m
0 <= coli, colj < n
All the positions in guards and walls are unique.



# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int countUnguarded(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& guards, vector<vector<int>>& walls) {
        // Initialize grid with zeros
        int g[m][n];
        memset(g, 0, sizeof(g));
        
        // Mark guards and walls as 2
        for (auto& e : guards) {
            g[e[0]][e[1]] = 2;
        }
        for (auto& e : walls) {
            g[e[0]][e[1]] = 2;
        }
        
        // Directions: up, right, down, left
        int dirs[5] = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};
        
        // Process each guard's line of sight
        for (auto& e : guards) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
                int x = e[0], y = e[1];
                int dx = dirs[k], dy = dirs[k + 1];
                
                // Check cells in current direction until hitting boundary or obstacle
                while (x + dx >= 0 && x + dx < m && y + dy >= 0 && y + dy < n && g[x + dx][y + dy] < 2) {
                    x += dx;
                    y += dy;

# 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/description)
 
Medium
 
Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i] is the color of the ith balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

 

Example 1:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/ballon1.jpg)

Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 3

Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.


Example 2:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon2.jpg)

Input: colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]

Output: 0

Explanation: The rope is already colorful. Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.


Example 3:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/13/balloon3.jpg)

Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]

Output: 2

Explanation: Bob will remove the balloons at indices 0 and 4. Each balloons takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
 

Constraints:

n == colors.length == neededTime.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= neededTime[i] <= 104
colors contains only lowercase English letters.


# Code
```cpp []

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
        int totalTime = 0; 
        int i = 0, j = 0; 

        while (i < neededTime.size() && j < neededTime.size()) {
            int currTotal = 0, currMax = 0; 

            while (j < neededTime.size() && colors[i] == colors[j]) {
                currTotal += neededTime[j];
        
                currMax = max(currMax, neededTime[j]); 
                                                       
                j++;
            }

            totalTime += currTotal - currMax; 
            i = j; 
        }
        return totalTime;

# 3318. Find X-Sum of All K-Long Subarrays I -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-x-sum-of-all-k-long-subarrays-i)
 
Easy
 
You are given an array nums of n integers and two integers k and x.

The x-sum of an array is calculated by the following procedure:

Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.
Keep only the occurrences of the top x most frequent elements. If two elements have the same number of occurrences, the element with the bigger value is considered more frequent.
Calculate the sum of the resulting array.
Note that if an array has less than x distinct elements, its x-sum is the sum of the array.

Return an integer array answer of length n - k + 1 where answer[i] is the x-sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], k = 6, x = 2

Output: [6,10,12]

Explanation:

For subarray [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4], only elements 1 and 2 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2.
For subarray [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], only elements 2 and 4 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[1] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4. Note that 4 is kept in the array since it is bigger than 3 and 1 which occur the same number of times.
For subarray [2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3], only elements 2 and 3 are kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[2] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3.



Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,8,7,8,7,5], k = 2, x = 2

Output: [11,15,15,15,12]

Explanation:

Since k == x, answer[i] is equal to the sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].

 

Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50
1 <= x <= k <= nums.length



# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    using int2=pair<int, int>;
    static int x_sum( const auto& freq, int k, int x){
        auto freq2=freq;
        sort(freq2.begin(), freq2.end(), greater<int2>());
        int sum=0;
        for (int i=0; i<x; i++){
            auto [f, num]=freq2[i];
            if (f==0) break;
            sum+=num*f;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    static vector<int> findXSum(vector<int>& nums, int k, int x) {
        const int n=nums.size(), sz=n-k+1;
        vector<int> ans(sz);
        array<int2, 51> freq;
        freq.fill({0, 0});
        for(int r=0; r<k; r++){
            int z=nums[r];
            freq[z].second=z;
            freq[z].first++;
        }
        ans[0]=x_sum(freq, k, x);
        for(int l=1, r=k; l<sz; l++, r++){
            int L=nums[l-1], R=nums[r];
            freq[L].first--;
            freq[R].first++;
            freq[R].second = R;
            ans[l]=x_sum(freq, k, x);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};


auto init = []() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);

Return an integer array answer of length n - k + 1 where answer[i] is the x-sum of the subarray nums[i..i + k - 1].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], k = 6, x = 2

Output: [6,10,12]

Explanation:

For subarray [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4], only elements 1 and 2 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2.
For subarray [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2], only elements 2 and 4 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, answer[1] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4. Note that 4 is kept in the array since it is bigger than 3 and 1 which occur the same number of times.

# 3607. Power Grid Maintenance -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-grid-maintenance/description/)
 
Medium
 
You are given an integer c representing c power stations, each with a unique identifier id from 1 to c (1‑based indexing).

These stations are interconnected via n bidirectional cables, represented by a 2D array connections, where each element connections[i] = [ui, vi] indicates a connection between station ui and station vi. Stations that are directly or indirectly connected form a power grid.

Initially, all stations are online (operational).

You are also given a 2D array queries, where each query is one of the following two types:

[1, x]: A maintenance check is requested for station x. If station x is online, it resolves the check by itself. If station x is offline, the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id in the same power grid as x. If no operational station exists in that grid, return -1.

[2, x]: Station x goes offline (i.e., it becomes non-operational).

Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type [1, x] in the order they appear.

Note: The power grid preserves its structure; an offline (non‑operational) node remains part of its grid and taking it offline does not alter connectivity.

 

Example 1:

Input: c = 5, connections = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], queries = [[1,3],[2,1],[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]]

Output: [3,2,3]

Explanation:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/04/15/powergrid.jpg)

Initially, all stations {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are online and form a single power grid.
Query [1,3]: Station 3 is online, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 3.
Query [2,1]: Station 1 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {2, 3, 4, 5}.
Query [1,1]: Station 1 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {2, 3, 4, 5}, which is station 2.
Query [2,2]: Station 2 goes offline. The remaining online stations are {3, 4, 5}.
Query [1,2]: Station 2 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest id among {3, 4, 5}, which is station 3.



Example 2:

Input: c = 3, connections = [], queries = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]]

Output: [1,-1]

Explanation:

There are no connections, so each station is its own isolated grid.
Query [1,1]: Station 1 is online in its isolated grid, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 1.
Query [2,1]: Station 1 goes offline.
Query [1,1]: Station 1 is offline and there are no other stations in its grid, so the result is -1.

1 <= c <= 105
0 <= n == connections.length <= min(105, c * (c - 1) / 2)

# 2528. Maximize the Minimum Powered City -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-minimum-powered-city/description)

Hard
 
You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.
The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.

Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.

Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.

 

Example 1:

Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2

Output: 5

Explanation: 

One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
So the minimum power of a city is 5.
Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.


Example 2:

Input: stations = [4,4,4,4], r = 0, k = 3

Output: 4

Explanation: 
It can be proved that we cannot make the minimum power of a city greater than 4.

# 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero)

Hard
 
Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:

Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
"11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.



Example 2:

Input: n = 6

Output: 4

Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
"110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
"010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
"011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
"001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 109


# Code

# 2169. Count Operations to Obtain Zero -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-operations-to-obtain-zero/description)
 
Easy
 
You are given two non-negative integers num1 and num2.

In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.

For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. However, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.
Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: 

- Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3. Since num1 < num2, we subtract num1 from num2 and get num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
- Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 1. Since num1 == 0, we do not need to perform any further operations.
So the total number of operations required is 3.


Example 2:

Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 10

Output: 1

Explanation: 

- Operation 1: num1 = 10, num2 = 10. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1 and get num1 = 10 - 10 = 0.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 10. Since num1 == 0, we are done.
So the total number of operations required is 1.
 

Constraints:

0 <= num1, num2 <= 105


# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int countOperations(int num1, int num2, int cnt=0) {
        return (num1==0 || num2==0)?cnt:countOperations(num2, num1%num2, cnt+num1/num2);
    }
};

# 3542. Minimum Operations to Convert All Elements to Zero -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-all-elements-to-zero)

Medium
 
You are given an array nums of size n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become 0.

In one operation, you can select a subarray [i, j] (where 0 <= i <= j < n) and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,2]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Select the subarray [1,1] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 1.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,1]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Select subarray [1,3] (which is [1,2,1]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 1. Setting all occurrences of 1 to 0 results in [3,0,2,0].
Select subarray [2,2] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [3,0,0,0].
Select subarray [0,0] (which is [3]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 3. Setting all occurrences of 3 to 0 results in [0,0,0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 3.


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

Select subarray [0,5] (which is [1,2,1,2,1,2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 1. Setting all occurrences of 1 to 0 results in [0,2,0,2,0,2].
Select subarray [1,1] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0,0,2,0,2].
Select subarray [3,3] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0,0,0,0,2].
Select subarray [5,5] (which is [2]), where the minimum non-negative integer is 2. Setting all occurrences of 2 to 0 results in [0,0,0,0,0,0].
Thus, the minimum number of operations required is 4.

You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.

Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.

A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3

Output: 4

Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.

You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisiting of positive integers. You can do the following operation on the array any number of times:

Select an index i such that 0 <= i < n - 1 and replace either of nums[i] or nums[i+1] with their gcd value.
Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.

The gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,6,3,4]

Output: 4

Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[2] with gcd(3,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,6,1,4].
- Choose index i = 1 and replace nums[1] with gcd(6,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [2,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 0 and replace nums[0] with gcd(2,1) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,4].
- Choose index i = 2 and replace nums[3] with gcd(1,4) = 1. Now we have nums = [1,1,1,1].

Move the character s[i] to the right until it reaches the end of the string or another '1'. For example, for s = "010010", if we choose i = 1, the resulting string will be s = "000110".
Return the maximum number of operations that you can perform.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1001101"

Output: 4

Explanation:

We can perform the following operations:

Choose index i = 0. The resulting string is s = "0011101".
Choose index i = 4. The resulting string is s = "0011011".
Choose index i = 3. The resulting string is s = "0010111".
Choose index i = 2. The resulting string is s = "0001111".
Example 2:

Input: s = "00111"

Output: 0

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.


# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(string s) {
        int ones = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '1')
                ones++;
            else if ((i > 0) && s[i - 1] == '1')
                res += ones;
        }

        return res;
    }

# 2536. Increment Submatrices by One -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/increment-submatrices-by-one)
 
Topics
 
You are given a positive integer n, indicating that we initially have an n x n 0-indexed integer matrix mat filled with zeroes.

You are also given a 2D integer array query. For each query[i] = [row1i, col1i, row2i, col2i], you should do the following operation:

Add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (row1i, col1i) and the bottom right corner (row2i, col2i). That is, add 1 to mat[x][y] for all row1i <= x <= row2i and col1i <= y <= col2i.
Return the matrix mat after performing every query.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]
Output: [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix, the matrix after the first query, and the matrix after the second query.
- In the first query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (1, 1) and bottom right corner (2, 2).
- In the second query, we add 1 to every element in the submatrix with the top left corner (0, 0) and bottom right corner (1, 1).
Example 2:


Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0,1,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the initial matrix and the matrix after the first query.
- In the first query we add 1 to every element in the matrix.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 500
1 <= queries.length <= 104
0 <= row1i <= row2i < n
0 <= col1i <= col2i < n

# 2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/keep-multiplying-found-values-by-two/description)
 
Easy
 
You are given an array of integers nums. You are also given an integer original which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.

You then do the following steps:

If original is found in nums, multiply it by two (i.e., set original = 2 * original).
Otherwise, stop the process.
Repeat this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.
Return the final value of original.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3

Output: 24

Explanation: 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4

Output: 4

Explanation:
- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
 

Constraints:

# 1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5

Easy
 
You are given a binary array nums (0-indexed).

We define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).

For example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5.
Return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]

Output: [true,false,false]

Explanation: The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.
Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.



Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]

Output: [false,false,false]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
