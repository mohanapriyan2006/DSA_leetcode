# 2561. Rearranging Fruits -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearranging-fruits/description/)
 
Hard
 
You have two fruit baskets containing n fruits each. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays basket1 and basket2 representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets equal. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

Chose two indices i and j, and swap the ith fruit of basket1 with the jth fruit of basket2.
The cost of the swap is min(basket1[i],basket2[j]).
Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or -1 if impossible.

 

Example 1:

Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.


Example 2:

Input: basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.
 

Constraints:

basket1.length == basket2.length
1 <= basket1.length <= 105
1 <= basket1[i],basket2[i] <= 109

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  long long minCost(vector<int>& basket1, vector<int>& basket2) {
    vector<int> swapped;
    unordered_map<int, int> count;

    for (const int b : basket1)
      ++count[b];

    for (const int b : basket2)
      --count[b];

    for (const auto& [num, freq] : count) {
      if (freq % 2 != 0)
        return -1;
      for (int i = 0; i < abs(freq) / 2; ++i)
        swapped.push_back(num);
    }

    const int minNum = min(ranges::min(basket1), ranges::min(basket2));
    const auto midIt = swapped.begin() + swapped.size() / 2;
    nth_element(swapped.begin(), midIt, swapped.end());
    return accumulate(swapped.begin(), midIt, 0L, [minNum](long acc, int num) {
      return acc + min(2 * minNum, num);
    });
  }
};

# 2106. Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-fruits-harvested-after-at-most-k-steps/description)
 
Hard
 
Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array fruits where fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti] depicts amounti fruits at the position positioni. fruits is already sorted by positioni in ascending order, and each positioni is unique.

You are also given an integer startPos and an integer k. Initially, you are at the position startPos. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most k steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.

Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest.

 

Example 1:

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/21/1.png)

Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation: 
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.


Example 2:

![example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/21/2.png)

Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: 
You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
The optimal way is to:
- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.


Example 3:


Input: fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
You can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits.
 

Constraints:

1 <= fruits.length <= 105
fruits[i].length == 2
0 <= startPos, positioni <= 2 * 105
positioni-1 < positioni for any i > 0 (0-indexed)
1 <= amounti <= 104
0 <= k <= 2 * 105

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxTotalFruits(vector<vector<int>>& fruits, int startPos, int k) {
    const int maxRight = max(startPos, fruits.back()[0]);
    int ans = 0;
    vector<int> amounts(1 + maxRight);
    vector<int> prefix(2 + maxRight);

    for (const vector<int>& f : fruits)
      amounts[f[0]] = f[1];

    partial_sum(amounts.begin(), amounts.end(), prefix.begin() + 1);

    auto getFruits = [&](int leftSteps, int rightSteps) {
      const int l = max(0, startPos - leftSteps);
      const int r = min(maxRight, startPos + rightSteps);
      return prefix[r + 1] - prefix[l];
    };

    // Go right first.
    const int maxRightSteps = min(maxRight - startPos, k);
    for (int rightSteps = 0; rightSteps <= maxRightSteps; ++rightSteps) {
      const int leftSteps = max(0, k - 2 * rightSteps);  // Turn left
      ans = max(ans, getFruits(leftSteps, rightSteps));
    }

    // Go left first.
    const int maxLeftSteps = min(startPos, k);
    for (int leftSteps = 0; leftSteps <= maxLeftSteps; ++leftSteps) {
      const int rightSteps = max(0, k - 2 * leftSteps);  // Turn right
      ans = max(ans, getFruits(leftSteps, rightSteps));
    }

    return ans;

# 904. Fruit Into Baskets -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/description)
 
Medium

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

 

Example 1:

Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.


Example 2:

Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].


Example 3:

Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
 

Constraints:

1 <= fruits.length <= 105
0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length


# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
    int ans = 0;
    unordered_map<int, int> count;

    for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < fruits.size(); ++r) {
      ++count[fruits[r]];
      while (count.size() > 2) {
        if (--count[fruits[l]] == 0)
          count.erase(fruits[l]);
        ++l;
      }
      ans = max(ans, r - l + 1);
    }

    return ans;
  }
};

# 3477. Fruits Into Baskets II -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruits-into-baskets-ii/description/)
 
Easy
 
You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.
Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

 

Example 1:

Input: fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]

Output: 1

Explanation:

fruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.
fruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.
fruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.
Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.

Example 2:

Input: fruits = [3,6,1], baskets = [6,4,7]

Output: 0

Explanation:

fruits[0] = 3 is placed in baskets[0] = 6.
fruits[1] = 6 cannot be placed in baskets[1] = 4 (insufficient capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, baskets[2] = 7.
fruits[2] = 1 is placed in baskets[1] = 4.
Since all fruits are successfully placed, we return 0.

n == fruits.length == baskets.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 1000

# 3363. Find the Maximum Number of Fruits Collected -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-number-of-fruits-collected/description)
 
Hard
 
There is a game dungeon comprised of n x n rooms arranged in a grid.

You are given a 2D array fruits of size n x n, where fruits[i][j] represents the number of fruits in the room (i, j). Three children will play in the game dungeon, with initial positions at the corner rooms (0, 0), (0, n - 1), and (n - 1, 0).

The children will make exactly n - 1 moves according to the following rules to reach the room (n - 1, n - 1):

The child starting from (0, 0) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i + 1, j + 1), (i + 1, j), and (i, j + 1) if the target room exists.
The child starting from (0, n - 1) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), and (i + 1, j + 1) if the target room exists.
The child starting from (n - 1, 0) must move from their current room (i, j) to one of the rooms (i - 1, j + 1), (i, j + 1), and (i + 1, j + 1) if the target room exists.
When a child enters a room, they will collect all the fruits there. If two or more children enter the same room, only one child will collect the fruits, and the room will be emptied after they leave.

Return the maximum number of fruits the children can collect from the dungeon.

 

Example 1:

Input: fruits = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,8,7],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]]

Output: 100

Explanation:
![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/10/15/example_1.gif)


In this example:

The 1st child (green) moves on the path (0,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,2) -> (3, 3).
The 2nd child (red) moves on the path (0,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,3) -> (3, 3).
The 3rd child (blue) moves on the path (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3, 3).
In total they collect 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 100 fruits.

Example 2:

Input: fruits = [[1,1],[1,1]]

Output: 4

Explanation:

In this example:

The 1st child moves on the path (0,0) -> (1,1).
The 2nd child moves on the path (0,1) -> (1,1).
The 3rd child moves on the path (1,0) -> (1,1).
In total they collect 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 fruits.

# 808. Soup Servings -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/description/)
 
Medium
 
You have two soups, A and B, each starting with n mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen at random, each with probability 0.25 independent of all previous turns:

pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B
pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B
pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B
pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B
Note:

There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.
The amounts from A and B are poured simultaneously during the turn.
If an operation asks you to pour more than you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.
The process stops immediately after any turn in which one of the soups is used up.

Return the probability that A is used up before B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the same turn. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 50
Output: 0.62500
Explanation: 
If we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
If we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.


Example 2:

Input: n = 100
Output: 0.71875
Explanation: 
If we perform the first serving operation, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the second serving operations, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2, 3], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 4.
If we perform the third operation, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 3.
If we perform the fourth operation, A will become empty on performing operation 1, and both A and B become empty on performing operation 2.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.71875.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 109

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  double soupServings(int n) {
    return n >= 4800 ? 1.0 : dfs((n + 24) / 25, (n + 24) / 25);

# 2438. Range Product Queries of Powers -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-product-queries-of-powers/description/)
 
Medium
 
Given a positive integer n, there exists a 0-indexed array called powers, composed of the minimum number of powers of 2 that sum to n. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order, and there is only one way to form the array.

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array queries, where queries[i] = [lefti, righti]. Each queries[i] represents a query where you have to find the product of all powers[j] with lefti <= j <= righti.

Return an array answers, equal in length to queries, where answers[i] is the answer to the ith query. Since the answer to the ith query may be too large, each answers[i] should be returned modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 15, queries = [[0,1],[2,2],[0,3]]
Output: [2,4,64]
Explanation:
For n = 15, powers = [1,2,4,8]. It can be shown that powers cannot be a smaller size.
Answer to 1st query: powers[0] * powers[1] = 1 * 2 = 2.
Answer to 2nd query: powers[2] = 4.
Answer to 3rd query: powers[0] * powers[1] * powers[2] * powers[3] = 1 * 2 * 4 * 8 = 64.
Each answer modulo 109 + 7 yields the same answer, so [2,4,64] is returned.


Example 2:

Input: n = 2, queries = [[0,0]]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
For n = 2, powers = [2].
The answer to the only query is powers[0] = 2. The answer modulo 109 + 7 is the same, so [2] is returned.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109
1 <= queries.length <= 105
0 <= starti <= endi < powers.length
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<int> productQueries(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {

    constexpr int kMaxBit = 30;
    vector<int> ans;
    vector<int> pows;

    for (int i = 0; i < kMaxBit; ++i)
      if (n >> i & 1)
        pows.push_back(1 << i);

    for (const vector<int>& query : queries) {
      const int left = query[0];
      const int right = query[1];
      long prod = 1;
      for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
        prod *= pows[i];
        prod %= kMod;

# 2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-express-an-integer-as-sum-of-powers/description/)
 
Medium
 
Given two positive integers n and x.

Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the xth power of unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers [n1, n2, ..., nk] where n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx.

Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 23 + 33 + 53.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, x = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can express n as the following: n = 32 + 12 = 10.
It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2nd power of unique integers.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, x = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
- n = 41 = 4.
- n = 31 + 11 = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 300
1 <= x <= 5

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  int numberOfWays(int n, int x) {
    constexpr int kMod = 1'000'000'007;
    // dp[i] := the number of ways to express i
    vector<int> dp(n + 1);
    int ax;  // a^x

    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int a = 1; (ax = pow(a, x)) <= n; ++a)
      for (int i = n; i >= ax; --i) {
        dp[i] += dp[i - ax];
        dp[i] %= kMod;
      }

    return dp[n];
  }
};

# 2264. Largest 3-Same-Digit Number in String -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-3-same-digit-number-in-string/)
  
Easy
 
You are given a string num representing a large integer. An integer is good if it meets the following conditions:

It is a substring of num with length 3.
It consists of only one unique digit.
Return the maximum good integer as a string or an empty string "" if no such integer exists.

Note:

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
There may be leading zeroes in num or a good integer.
 

Example 1:

Input: num = "6777133339"
Output: "777"
Explanation: There are two distinct good integers: "777" and "333".
"777" is the largest, so we return "777".

Example 2:

Input: num = "2300019"
Output: "000"
Explanation: "000" is the only good integer.


Example 3:

Input: num = "42352338"
Output: ""
Explanation: No substring of length 3 consists of only one unique digit. Therefore, there are no good integers.
 

Constraints:

3 <= num.length <= 1000
num only consists of digits.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    string largestGoodInteger(string num) {
        int result = -1;
        int n = num.size() ;
