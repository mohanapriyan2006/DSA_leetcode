# 3330. Find the Original Typed String I -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-i/description/)

Easy

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "abbcccc"

Output: 5

Explanation:

The possible strings are: "abbcccc", "abbccc", "abbcc", "abbc", and "abcccc".

Example 2:

Input: word = "abcd"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible string is "abcd".

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaaa"

Output: 4

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 100
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int possibleStringCount(string word) {
        int ans = 1;

        for(int i=1 ; i<word.length() ; ++i){
            if(word[i] == word[i-1]) ans++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

# 344. Reverse String -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/)

Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
      int i=0 , j = s.size() -1;

      while(i<j){
        char c = s[i];
        s[i++] = s[j];
        s[j--] = c;
      }
    }
};

# 151. Reverse Words in a String -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/)
 
Medium

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"


Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.


Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
 

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        vector<string> words;

        string word;

        for(const char c:s){
            if(c != ' '){
                word+=c;
            }else if(c == ' ' && !word.empty() ){
                words.push_back(word);
                word.clear();
            }
        }

        if(!word.empty()){
           words.push_back(word);
           word.clear();
        }

        string ans;

        for(int i=words.size() - 1 ; i>=0 ; --i){
            ans+=words[i];
            if( i != 0) ans+=' ';
        }

        return ans;


    }

# 3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i/description/)

Easy

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer k.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.

Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 5

Output: "b"

Explanation:

Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:

Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".


Example 2:

Input: k = 10

Output: "c"

 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 500

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(unsigned k) {
        return 'a' + popcount(k-1);

# 20. Valid Parentheses -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

Easy

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"

Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"

Output: false

Example 4:

Input: s = "([])"

Output: true

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(string s) {

        stack<char> st;

# 3307. Find the K-th Character in String Game II -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-ii/description/)

Hard

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer k. You are also given an integer array operations, where operations[i] represents the type of the ith operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform all operations in sequence:

If operations[i] == 0, append a copy of word to itself.
If operations[i] == 1, generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word. For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".
Return the value of the kth character in word after performing all the operations.

Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the second type of operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 5, operations = [0,0,0]

Output: "a"

Explanation:

Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the three operations as follows:

Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
Appends "aa" to "aa", word becomes "aaaa".
Appends "aaaa" to "aaaa", word becomes "aaaaaaaa".


Example 2:

Input: k = 10, operations = [0,1,0,1]

Output: "b"

Explanation:

Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the four operations as follows:

Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
Appends "bb" to "aa", word becomes "aabb".
Appends "aabb" to "aabb", word becomes "aabbaabb".
Appends "bbccbbcc" to "aabbaabb", word becomes "aabbaabbbbccbbcc".
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 1014
1 <= operations.length <= 100
operations[i] is either 0 or 1.
The input is generated such that word has at least k characters after all operations.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  char kthCharacter(long long k, vector<int>& operations) {
    const int operationsCount = ceil(log2(k));
    int increases = 0;

    for (int i = operationsCount - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
      const long halfSize = 1L << i;
      if (k > halfSize) {
        k -= halfSize;
        increases += operations[i];
      }
    }

    return 'a' + increases % 26;

# 155. Min Stack -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/)

Medium

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

 

Example 1:

Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
 

Constraints:

-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

# Code
```cpp []
class MinStack {
public:
    
    void push(int val) {
        if(st.empty()) st.emplace(val,val);
        else{

            st.emplace(val,mini);
        }
    }
    
    void pop() {
        st.pop();
    }
    
    int top() {
        return st.top().first;
    }
    
    int getMin() {

# 225. Implement Stack using Queues -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/description)

Easy

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyStack class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

Explanation
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False
 

Constraints:

1 <= x <= 9
At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
All the calls to pop and top are valid.
 

Follow-up: Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

# Code
```cpp []
class MyStack {
public:
    
    void push(int x) {
        st.push(x);
        for(int i=0 ; i<st.size() - 1 ; ++i){
            st.push(st.front());
            st.pop();
        }
    }
    
    int pop() {
        int n = st.front();
        st.pop();
        return n;
    }
    
    int top() {
        return st.front();

Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.


Example 3:

Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 500
1 <= arr[i] <= 500

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {

# 1865. Finding Pairs With a Certain Sum -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/finding-pairs-with-a-certain-sum/description)

Medium

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2. You are tasked to implement a data structure that supports queries of two types:

Add a positive integer to an element of a given index in the array nums2.
Count the number of pairs (i, j) such that nums1[i] + nums2[j] equals a given value (0 <= i < nums1.length and 0 <= j < nums2.length).
Implement the FindSumPairs class:

FindSumPairs(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) Initializes the FindSumPairs object with two integer arrays nums1 and nums2.
void add(int index, int val) Adds val to nums2[index], i.e., apply nums2[index] += val.
int count(int tot) Returns the number of pairs (i, j) such that nums1[i] + nums2[j] == tot.
 

Example 1:

Input
["FindSumPairs", "count", "add", "count", "count", "add", "add", "count"]
[[[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [1, 4, 5, 2, 5, 4]], [7], [3, 2], [8], [4], [0, 1], [1, 1], [7]]
Output
[null, 8, null, 2, 1, null, null, 11]

Explanation

FindSumPairs findSumPairs = new FindSumPairs([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [1, 4, 5, 2, 5, 4]);
findSumPairs.count(7);  // return 8; pairs (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) make 2 + 5 and pairs (5,1), (5,5) make 3 + 4
findSumPairs.add(3, 2); // now nums2 = [1,4,5,4,5,4]
findSumPairs.count(8);  // return 2; pairs (5,2), (5,4) make 3 + 5
findSumPairs.count(4);  // return 1; pair (5,0) makes 3 + 1
findSumPairs.add(0, 1); // now nums2 = [2,4,5,4,5,4]
findSumPairs.add(1, 1); // now nums2 = [2,5,5,4,5,4]
findSumPairs.count(7);  // return 11; pairs (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4) make 2 + 5 and pairs (5,3), (5,5) make 3 + 4

# I1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/description/)

Topics

You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

 

Example 1:


Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.

Example 2:

Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= events.length <= 105
events[i].length == 2

            // next available event.
            if (minHeap.empty())
                d = events[i][0];
            // All the events starting from today are newly available.

# 1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/description)

Hard

You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]. The ith event starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of valuei. You are also given an integer k which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.

 

Example 1:



Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.


Example 2:



Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k events.


Example 3:



Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= events.length
1 <= k * events.length <= 106
1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 109
1 <= valuei <= 106

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> mem(events.size(), vector<int>(k + 1, -1));
        ranges::sort(events);
        return maxValue(events, 0, k, mem);
    }

private:
    // Returns the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending
    // events[i..n), where k is the maximum number of attendancevents.

# 735. Asteroid Collision

Medium

We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row. The indices of the asteriod in the array represent their relative position in space.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

 

Example 1:

Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.


Example 2:

Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.


Example 3:

Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
 

Constraints:

2 <= asteroids.length <= 104
-1000 <= asteroids[i] <= 1000
asteroids[i] != 0

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans;

        for(const int n:nums){
            bool isExplode = false;
            while(!ans.empty() && n < 0 && ans.back() > 0){
                if(abs(ans.back()) < abs(n)) ans.pop_back();
                else if(abs(ans.back()) == abs(n)){
                    ans.pop_back();
                    isExplode = true;
                    break;
                }else{
                    isExplode = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
