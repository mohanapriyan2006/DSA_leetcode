# 3330. Find the Original Typed String I -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-i/description/)

Easy

Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "abbcccc"

Output: 5

Explanation:

The possible strings are: "abbcccc", "abbccc", "abbcc", "abbc", and "abcccc".

Example 2:

Input: word = "abcd"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible string is "abcd".

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaaa"

Output: 4

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 100
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int possibleStringCount(string word) {
        int ans = 1;

        for(int i=1 ; i<word.length() ; ++i){
            if(word[i] == word[i-1]) ans++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

# 344. Reverse String -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/)

Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
      int i=0 , j = s.size() -1;

      while(i<j){
        char c = s[i];
        s[i++] = s[j];
        s[j--] = c;
      }
    }
};

# 151. Reverse Words in a String -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/)
 
Medium

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"


Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.


Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
 

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        vector<string> words;

        string word;

        for(const char c:s){
            if(c != ' '){
                word+=c;
            }else if(c == ' ' && !word.empty() ){
                words.push_back(word);
                word.clear();
            }
        }

        if(!word.empty()){
           words.push_back(word);
           word.clear();
        }

        string ans;

        for(int i=words.size() - 1 ; i>=0 ; --i){
            ans+=words[i];
            if( i != 0) ans+=' ';
        }

        return ans;


    }

# 3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i/description/)

Easy

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer k.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.

Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 5

Output: "b"

Explanation:

Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:

Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".


Example 2:

Input: k = 10

Output: "c"

 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 500

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(unsigned k) {
        return 'a' + popcount(k-1);

# 20. Valid Parentheses -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

Easy

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"

Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"

Output: false

Example 4:

Input: s = "([])"

Output: true

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(string s) {

        stack<char> st;

# 3307. Find the K-th Character in String Game II -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-ii/description/)

Hard

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer k. You are also given an integer array operations, where operations[i] represents the type of the ith operation.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform all operations in sequence:

If operations[i] == 0, append a copy of word to itself.
If operations[i] == 1, generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word. For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".
Return the value of the kth character in word after performing all the operations.

Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the second type of operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 5, operations = [0,0,0]

Output: "a"

Explanation:

Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the three operations as follows:

Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
Appends "aa" to "aa", word becomes "aaaa".
Appends "aaaa" to "aaaa", word becomes "aaaaaaaa".


Example 2:

Input: k = 10, operations = [0,1,0,1]

Output: "b"

Explanation:

Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the four operations as follows:

Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
Appends "bb" to "aa", word becomes "aabb".
Appends "aabb" to "aabb", word becomes "aabbaabb".
Appends "bbccbbcc" to "aabbaabb", word becomes "aabbaabbbbccbbcc".
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 1014
1 <= operations.length <= 100
operations[i] is either 0 or 1.
The input is generated such that word has at least k characters after all operations.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  char kthCharacter(long long k, vector<int>& operations) {
    const int operationsCount = ceil(log2(k));
    int increases = 0;

    for (int i = operationsCount - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
      const long halfSize = 1L << i;
      if (k > halfSize) {
        k -= halfSize;
        increases += operations[i];
      }
    }

    return 'a' + increases % 26;

# 155. Min Stack -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/)

Medium

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

 

Example 1:

Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
 

Constraints:

-231 <= val <= 231 - 1
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

# Code
```cpp []
class MinStack {
public:
    
    void push(int val) {
        if(st.empty()) st.emplace(val,val);
        else{

            st.emplace(val,mini);
        }
    }
    
    void pop() {
        st.pop();
    }
    
    int top() {
        return st.top().first;
    }
    
    int getMin() {

# 225. Implement Stack using Queues -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/description)

Easy

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyStack class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
Notes:

You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

Explanation
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False
 

Constraints:

1 <= x <= 9
At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
All the calls to pop and top are valid.
 

Follow-up: Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

# Code
```cpp []
class MyStack {
public:
    
    void push(int x) {
        st.push(x);

            st.push(st.front());
            st.pop();
        }
    }
    
    int pop() {
        int n = st.front();
        st.pop();
        return n;
    }
    
    int top() {
        return st.front();

# 1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/description)

Hard

You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]. The ith event starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of valuei. You are also given an integer k which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.

 

Example 1:



Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.


Example 2:



Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k events.


Example 3:



Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3

# 692. Top K Frequent Words -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/description/)

Medium

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

Example 2:

Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 500
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]
 

Follow-up: Could you solve it in O(n log(k)) time and O(n) extra space?

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> topKFrequent(vector<string>& words, int k) {

        map<string, int> freq;

        for (auto i : words) {
            freq[i]++;
        }

        vector<string> ans;

        vector<pair<string, int>> pp(freq.begin(), freq.end());

        sort(pp.begin(), pp.end(),
             [](pair<string, int>& a, pair<string, int>& b) {
                if(a.second == b.second){
                    return a.first < b.first;
                }
                 return a.second > b.second;
             });

        int count = 0;

        for (auto it : pp) {

# 2402. Meeting Rooms III -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/description/)

Hard

You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.

A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 


Example 2:

Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1. 
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= meetings.length <= 105
meetings[i].length == 2
0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 105
All the values of starti are unique.

# Code

# 706. Design HashMap -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/description/)

Easy

Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement the MyHashMap class:

MyHashMap() initializes the object with an empty map.
void put(int key, int value) inserts a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the map, update the corresponding value.
int get(int key) returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
void remove(key) removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyHashMap", "put", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "remove", "get"]
[[], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3], [2, 1], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, -1, null, 1, null, -1]

Explanation
MyHashMap myHashMap = new MyHashMap();
myHashMap.put(1, 1); // The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.put(2, 2); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(1);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.get(3);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1], [2,2]]
myHashMap.put(2, 1); // The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]] (i.e., update the existing value)
myHashMap.get(2);    // return 1, The map is now [[1,1], [2,1]]
myHashMap.remove(2); // remove the mapping for 2, The map is now [[1,1]]
myHashMap.get(2);    // return -1 (i.e., not found), The map is now [[1,1]]
 

Constraints:

0 <= key, value <= 106
At most 104 calls will be made to put, get, and remove.

# Code
```cpp []
class MyHashMap {
    static const int SIZE = 1000001;
    int mp[SIZE];

public:

    int get(int key) {
        return (mp[key]);
    }

    void remove(int key) { mp[key] = -1; }
};

# 622. Design Circular Queue -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-queue/description/)

Medium

Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Implement the MyCircularQueue class:

MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.
int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language. 

 

Example 1:

Input
["MyCircularQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "Rear", "isFull", "deQueue", "enQueue", "Rear"]
[[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]
Output
[null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]

Explanation
MyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);
myCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False
myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3
myCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True
myCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True
myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4

# 1900. The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-and-latest-rounds-where-players-compete/description/)

Hard

There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).

The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
Player 1 competes against player 7.
Player 2 competes against player 6.
Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.
After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).

The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.

Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
One possible scenario which leads to the earliest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11
Third round: 2, 3, 4
One possible scenario which leads to the latest round number:
First round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Second round: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Third round: 1, 2, 4
Fourth round: 2, 4

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, firstPlayer = 1, secondPlayer = 5
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: The players numbered 1 and 5 compete in the first round.
There is no way to make them compete in any other round.

# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree -> [leetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)
Medium

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:


Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:

Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109

# 2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/description/)

Medium

You are given a 0-indexed integer array players, where players[i] represents the ability of the ith player. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array trainers, where trainers[j] represents the training capacity of the jth trainer.

The ith player can match with the jth trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the ith player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the jth trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.

 

Example 1:

Input: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]
Output: 2
Explanation:
One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:
- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.
- players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.

Example 2:

Input: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.
Each player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= players.length, trainers.length <= 105
1 <= players[i], trainers[j] <= 109
 

Note: This question is the same as 445: Assign Cookies.

# 224. Basic Calculator -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)
Hard

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

# 3136. Valid Word -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word/description/)

Easy

A word is considered valid if:

It contains a minimum of 3 characters.
It contains only digits (0-9), and English letters (uppercase and lowercase).
It includes at least one vowel.
It includes at least one consonant.
You are given a string word.

Return true if word is valid, otherwise, return false.

Notes:

'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and their uppercases are vowels.
A consonant is an English letter that is not a vowel.
 

Example 1:

Input: word = "234Adas"

Output: true

Explanation:

This word satisfies the conditions.

Example 2:

Input: word = "b3"

Output: false

Explanation:

The length of this word is fewer than 3, and does not have a vowel.

Example 3:

Input: word = "a3$e"

Output: false

Explanation:

This word contains a '$' character and does not have a consonant.

# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/description/)
Easy

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".


Example 2:

Input: s = "azxxzy"
Output: "ay"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string s) {
        string ans = "";
        for(const char c:s){
            if( !ans.empty() && ans.back() == c) ans.pop_back();

# 290. Word Pattern -> LeetCodehttps://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/description/

Easy

Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:

Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.
 

Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: true

Explanation:

The bijection can be established as:

'a' maps to "dog".
'b' maps to "cat".
Example 2:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: false

 

Constraints:

1 <= pattern.length <= 300
pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
1 <= s.length <= 3000
s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.

# Code

# 707. Design Linked List -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/description/)

Medium

Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement the MyLinkedList class:

MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.
int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.
void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
void deleteAtIndex(int index) Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyLinkedList", "addAtHead", "addAtTail", "addAtIndex", "get", "deleteAtIndex", "get"]
[[], [1], [3], [1, 2], [1], [1], [1]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 2, null, 3]

Explanation
MyLinkedList myLinkedList = new MyLinkedList();
myLinkedList.addAtHead(1);
myLinkedList.addAtTail(3);
myLinkedList.addAtIndex(1, 2);    // linked list becomes 1->2->3
myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 2
myLinkedList.deleteAtIndex(1);    // now the linked list is 1->3
myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 3

At most 2000 calls will be made to get, addAtHead, addAtTail, addAtIndex and deleteAtIndex.

# 141. Linked List Cycle -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description)

Easy

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).


Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.


Example 3:


Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

# 1995. Count Special Quadruplets -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-special-quadruplets/description/)

Easy

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, return the number of distinct quadruplets (a, b, c, d) such that:

nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d], and
a < b < c < d
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,6]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only quadruplet that satisfies the requirement is (0, 1, 2, 3) because 1 + 2 + 3 == 6.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,6,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no such quadruplets in [3,3,6,4,5].


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 quadruplets that satisfy the requirement are:
- (0, 1, 2, 3): 1 + 1 + 1 == 3
- (0, 1, 3, 4): 1 + 1 + 3 == 5
- (0, 2, 3, 4): 1 + 1 + 3 == 5

# 45. Jump Game II -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/)

Medium

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

# Code
```cpp []

# 2163. Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-in-sums-after-removal-of-elements/)

Hard

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:

The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.
The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.
Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 


Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.
 

Constraints:

nums.length == 3 * n
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 105

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {

  long long minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums) {

    // minLeftSum[i] := the minimum of the sum of n nums in nums[0..i)
    vector<long> minLeftSum(nums.size());

    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
      maxHeap.push(nums[i]);
      leftSum += nums[i];
      if (maxHeap.size() == n + 1)

# 112. Path Sum -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/)

Easy

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.


Example 3:

Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

# 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree/description)

Easy

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

 

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [2,2,5,null,null,5,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.


Example 2:

Input: root = [2,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 25].
1 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
root.val == min(root.left.val, root.right.val) for each internal node of the tree.

# 1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/description/)
Medium

Given a list of folders folder, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of folder[j] must start with folder[j], followed by a "/". For example, "/a/b" is a sub-folder of "/a", but "/b" is not a sub-folder of "/a/b/c".

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

For example, "/leetcode" and "/leetcode/problems" are valid paths while an empty string and "/" are not.
 

Example 1:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.


Example 2:

Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".


Example 3:

Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 104
2 <= folder[i].length <= 100
folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'.
folder[i] always starts with the character '/'.
Each folder name is unique.

# 1948. Delete Duplicate Folders in System -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-folders-in-system/description/)

Hard

Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.

For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.

For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:
/a
/a/x
/a/x/y
/a/z
/b
/b/x
/b/x/y
/b/z
However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders "/a" and "/b" would not be identical. Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still be considered identical even with the added folder.
Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.

Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:


Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["d"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["d","a"]]
Output: [["d"],["d","a"]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
Folders "/a" and "/c" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named "b".


Example 2:


Input: paths = [["a"],["c"],["a","b"],["c","b"],["a","b","x"],["a","b","x","y"],["w"],["w","y"]]
Output: [["c"],["c","b"],["a"],["a","b"]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown. 
Folders "/a/b/x" and "/w" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named "y".
Note that folders "/a" and "/c" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.


Example 3:


Input: paths = [["a","b"],["c","d"],["c"],["a"]]
Output: [["c"],["c","d"],["a"],["a","b"]]
Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.
 

Constraints:

1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= paths[i].length <= 500
1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10
1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 105
path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
No two paths lead to the same folder.
For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.

# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/)

Easy

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:


The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

Custom Judge:

The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
listA - The first linked list.
listB - The second linked list.
skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:


Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.


Example 2:

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.


Example 3:

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes of listA is in the m.
The number of nodes of listB is in the n.
1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104
1 <= Node.val <= 105
0 <= skipA <= m
0 <= skipB <= n
intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.
intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.

Medium

You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.

# 2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree -> [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-after-removals-on-a-tree/description/)
 
Hard
  
There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.
For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = 6, 1 ^ 9 = 8, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.
Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: 9
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
- The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [5,5,2,4,4,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[5,2],[4,3],[1,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [3,4] with values [4,4]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.
- The 2nd component has nodes [1,0] with values [5,5]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.
- The 3rd component has nodes [2,5] with values [2,2]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.
We cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
3 <= n <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 108
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < n

# 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/description/)
 
Medium
 
Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.


Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
0 <= limit <= 109

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int st = 0, end = 0;
        int stA = 0, endA = 0;

        deque<int> minQ, maxQ;

        while (end < n) {
            while (!minQ.empty() && nums[end] < nums[minQ.back()])
                minQ.pop_back();
            while (!maxQ.empty() && nums[end] > nums[maxQ.back()])
                maxQ.pop_back();
            minQ.push_back(end);
            maxQ.push_back(end);

            while (nums[maxQ.front()] - nums[minQ.front()] > limit) {
                if (st == minQ.front())
                    minQ.pop_front();
                if (st == maxQ.front())
                    maxQ.pop_front();
                st++;
            }

            if (end - st > endA - stA) {
                stA = st;
                endA = end;
            }

            end++;
        }

        return (endA - stA) + 1;
    }
};

# 32. Longest Valid Parentheses -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/description/)
 
Hard
 
Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".


Example 2:

Input: s = ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".

Example 3:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
s[i] is '(', or ')'.

```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int longestValidParentheses(string s) {
        stack<int> st;
        st.push(-1);
        int ans = 0;

        for(int i=0 ; i<s.size() ; ++i){
            if(s[i] == '(') st.push(i);
            else{
                st.pop();
                if(st.empty()) st.push(i);
                else ans = max(ans, i - st.top());
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
