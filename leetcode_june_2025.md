# Quick Sort -> [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/quick-sort/1) (GFG)

Difficulty: Medium
Implement Quick Sort, a Divide and Conquer algorithm, to sort an array, arr[] in ascending order. Given an array, arr[], with starting index low and ending index high, complete the functions partition() and quickSort(). Use the last element as the pivot so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot come before it, and elements greater than the pivot follow it.

Note: The low and high are inclusive.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]

Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]

Explanation: After sorting, all elements are arranged in ascending order.


Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 6, 10, 4, 1, 3, 9, 7]

Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]

Explanation: Duplicate elements (1) are retained in sorted order.


Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5]

Output: [5, 5, 5, 5]

Explanation: All elements are identical, so the array remains unchanged.


Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(log n)

# 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated -> [LINK](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/description)

Easy

Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length] for every valid index i.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums. 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool check(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int r = 0;

# 3443. Maximum Manhattan Distance After K Changes -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-manhattan-distance-after-k-changes/description/)

Medium

You are given a string s consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W', where s[i] indicates movements in an infinite grid:

'N' : Move north by 1 unit.
'S' : Move south by 1 unit.
'E' : Move east by 1 unit.
'W' : Move west by 1 unit.
Initially, you are at the origin (0, 0). You can change at most k characters to any of the four directions.

Find the maximum Manhattan distance from the origin that can be achieved at any time while performing the movements in order.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "NWSE", k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

Change s[2] from 'S' to 'N'. The string s becomes "NWNE".

Movement	Position (x, y)	Manhattan Distance	Maximum
s[0] == 'N'	(0, 1)	0 + 1 = 1	1
s[1] == 'W'	(-1, 1)	1 + 1 = 2	2
s[2] == 'N'	(-1, 2)	1 + 2 = 3	3
s[3] == 'E'	(0, 2)	0 + 2 = 2	3
The maximum Manhattan distance from the origin that can be achieved is 3. Hence, 3 is the output.

Example 2:

Input: s = "NSWWEW", k = 3

Output: 6

Explanation:

Change s[1] from 'S' to 'N', and s[4] from 'E' to 'W'. The string s becomes "NNWWWW".

The maximum Manhattan distance from the origin that can be achieved is 6. Hence, 6 is the output.

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
0 <= k <= s.length
s consists of only 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W'.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxDistance(string s, int k) {
    return max({flip(s, k, "NE"), flip(s, k, "NW"),  //
                flip(s, k, "SE"), flip(s, k, "SW")});
  }

 private:
  int flip(const string& s, int k, const string& direction) {
    int res = 0;
    int pos = 0;
    int opposite = 0;

    for (const char c : s) {
      if (direction.find(c) != string::npos) {
        ++pos;
      } else {
        --pos;

# 3085. Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special/description/)

Medium

You are given a string word and an integer k.

We consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.

Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.

Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0

Output: 3

Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.

Example 2:

Input: word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d". Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaabaaa", k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b". Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 105
0 <= k <= 105
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  int minimumDeletions(string word, int k) {
    int ans = INT_MAX;
    vector<int> count(26);

    for (const char c : word)
      ++count[c - 'a'];

    for (const int minFreq : count) {
      int deletions = 0;
      for (const int freq : count)
        if (freq < minFreq)  // Delete all the letters with smaller frequency.
          deletions += freq;
        else  // Delete letters with exceeding frequency.
          deletions += max(0, freq - (minFreq + k));
      ans = min(ans, deletions);
    }

    return ans;

# 2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-a-string-into-groups-of-size-k/description/)

Easy

A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:

The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each element can be a part of exactly one group.
For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.
Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.

Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
Explanation:
The first 3 characters "abc" form the first group.
The next 3 characters "def" form the second group.
The last 3 characters "ghi" form the third group.
Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
Thus, the groups formed are "abc", "def", and "ghi".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = "x"
Output: ["abc","def","ghi","jxx"]
Explanation:
Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups "abc", "def", and "ghi".
For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
Thus, the 4 groups formed are "abc", "def", "ghi", and "jxx".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters only.
1 <= k <= 100
fill is a lowercase English letter.



# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<string> divideString(string s, int k, char fill) {

    vector<string> ans;

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += k)
      ans.push_back(i + k > s.length()
                        ? s.substr(i) + string(i + k - s.length(), fill)
                        : s.substr(i, k));

# 66. Plus One -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/)

Easy

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
Example 2:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
Example 3:

Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].
 

Constraints:

1 <= digits.length <= 100
0 <= digits[i] <= 9
digits does not contain any leading 0's.


# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& nums) {

# 2200. Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-k-distant-indices-in-an-array/description)

Easy

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.

Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.
Thus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. 
Hence, we return [0,1,2,3,4].
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
key is an integer from the array nums.
1 <= k <= nums.length

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findKDistantIndices(vector<int>& nums, int key, int k) {
        vector<int> res;
        int n = nums.size();

        int end = 0;

        for(int i=0 ; i<n ; ++i){
            if(nums[i] == key){ 
                int rt = max(end , i-k);
                end = min(n-1 , i+k) + 1;

                for (int j = rt; j < end; ++j){   
                    res.push_back(j);
                }
            }
        }

# 2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/description/)

Medium

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

Note:

The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.
Example 2:

Input: s = "00101001", k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.
The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= k <= 109

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
 public:
  int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
    int oneCount = 0;
    int num = 0;
    int pow = 1;

    for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0 && num + pow <= k; --i) {
      if (s[i] == '1') {
        ++oneCount;
        num += pow;
      }
      pow *= 2;
    }

    return ranges::count(s, '0') + oneCount;
  }

# 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times -> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/description/)

Hard

You are given a string s of length n, and an integer k. You are tasked to find the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.

For example, "bba" is repeated 2 times in the string "bababcba", because the string "bbabba", constructed by concatenating "bba" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string "bababcba".
Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.

 

Example 1:

example 1

Input: s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
Output: "let"
Explanation: There are two longest subsequences repeated 2 times: "let" and "ete".
"let" is the lexicographically largest one.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bb", k = 2
Output: "b"
Explanation: The longest subsequence repeated 2 times is "b".

Example 3:

Input: s = "ab", k = 2
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no subsequence repeated 2 times. Empty string is returned.
 

Constraints:

n == s.length
2 <= n, k <= 2000
2 <= n < k * 8
s consists of lowercase English letters.

# Code
