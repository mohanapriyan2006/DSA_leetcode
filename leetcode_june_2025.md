# Quick Sort -> [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/quick-sort/1) (GFG)

Difficulty: Medium
Implement Quick Sort, a Divide and Conquer algorithm, to sort an array, arr[] in ascending order. Given an array, arr[], with starting index low and ending index high, complete the functions partition() and quickSort(). Use the last element as the pivot so that all elements less than or equal to the pivot come before it, and elements greater than the pivot follow it.

Note: The low and high are inclusive.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]

Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]

Explanation: After sorting, all elements are arranged in ascending order.


Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 6, 10, 4, 1, 3, 9, 7]

Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]

Explanation: Duplicate elements (1) are retained in sorted order.


Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5]

Output: [5, 5, 5, 5]

Explanation: All elements are identical, so the array remains unchanged.


Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(log n)

# Largest Element in Array -> [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-element-in-array4009/1) (GFG)

Difficulty: Basic

Given an array arr[]. The task is to find the largest element and return it.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 8, 7, 56, 90]
Output: 90
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 90.

Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10]
Output: 10
Explanation: There is only one element which is the largest.

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size()<= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 106

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
