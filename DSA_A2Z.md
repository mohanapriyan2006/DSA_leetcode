# Count Digits (GeeksForGeeks)
Difficulty: Easy
Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

Examples :

Input: n = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2 when both divide 12 leaves remainder 0.
Input: n = 2446
Output: 1
Explanation: Here among 2, 4, 6 only 2 divides 2446 evenly while 4 and 6 do not.
Input: n = 23
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 and 3, none of them divide 23 evenly.

```java []
class Solution {
    static int evenlyDivides(int n) {
        int dp = n;
        int rem;
        int ans = 0;
        while(n>0){
            rem = n % 10;
            if(rem != 0 && dp % rem == 0){
                ans++;
            }
            n/=10;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```

# 7. Reverse Integer (leetcode)

Medium

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {

        long ans = 0;
        while(x != 0){
            ans = (ans * 10) + (x % 10);
            x /= 10;
        }

        return (ans < Integer.MIN_VALUE || ans > Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? 0 : (int)ans;
    }
}
```

# 9. Palindrome Number (leetCode)
Easy

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        
        int d = x;

        int sum = 0;
        while(d>0){
            int rem = d%10;
            sum = (sum * 10) + rem;
            d/=10;
        }

        if(sum == x)
            return true;
        
        return false;
    }
}

# Check if a number is Armstrong Number or not

Problem Statement: Given an integer N, return true it is an Armstrong number otherwise return false.

An Amrstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Example 1:
Input:N = 153
Output:True
Explanation: 13+53+33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

## Example 2:
Input:N = 371
Output: True
Explanation: 33+53+13 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371

## Optimal Approach
Algorithm / Intuition
To check if a number is an armstrong number, we can use the algorithm created in Extract Digits.

An Armstrong number, also known as a narcissistic number or plenary number, is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Number of digits: 3, 153 = 13+53+33

We extract the digits of the number, raise each digit to the power of the total number of digits in the number. Sum up all the results obtained and check if the sum equals to the original number.

Algorithm
Step 1:Calculate the number of digits in the input number and store it in k. Read more about this Approach here: Count Digits

Step 2: Initialise a variable sum to 0. This variable will store the sum of each digit raised to the power of number of digits in number.

Make a copy of the original number to store it in a temporary variable.
Step 3: Run a while loop with the condition n>0 and at each iteration:

Get the last digit of n by using the modulus operator % with 10 and store it in a temporary variable ld.
Add the digit ld raised to the power of k of the sum.
Update n by integer division with 10 effectively removing the last digit.
Step 4: After the loop, check if the original input number is equal to the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

If they are equal, return true indicating the number is an Armstrong number.
If they are not equal, return false indicating that the number is not an Armstrong number.

# Code
```java []
                            
import java.lang.Math;

public class ArmstrongNumber {
    // Function to check if a
    // number is an Armstrong number
    public static boolean isArmstrong(int num) {
        // Calculate the number of
        // digits in the given number
        int k = String.valueOf(num).length();
        // Initialize the sum of digits
        // raised to the power of k to 0
        int sum = 0;
        // Copy the value of the input
        // number to a temporary variable n
        int n = num;
        // Iterate through each
        // digit of the number
        while(n > 0){
            // Extract the last
            // digit of the number
            int ld = n % 10;
            // Add the digit raised to
            // the power of k to the sum
            sum += Math.pow(ld, k); 
            // Remove the last digit
            // from the number
            n = n / 10;
        }
        // Check if the sum of digits raised to
        // the power of k equals the original number
        return sum == num ? true : false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 153;
        if (isArmstrong(number)) {
            System.out.println(number + " is an Armstrong number.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is not an Armstrong number.");
        }
    }
}

# Print all Divisors of a given Number


Problem Statement: Given an integer N, return all divisors of N.

A divisor of an integer N is a positive integer that divides N without leaving a remainder. In other words, if N is divisible by another integer without any remainder, then that integer is considered a divisor of N.


## Example 1:
Input:N = 36
Output:[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36]
Explanation: The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
## Example 2:
Input:N =12
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]
Explanation: The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.


## Optimal Approach

Algorithm / Intuition
We can optimise the previous approach by using the property that for any non-negative integer n, if d is a divisor of n then n/d is also a divisor of n.

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/b9c12c5c-c17c-4400-9629-df58affdae6b_1739207422.1479151.png)


This property is symmetric about the square root of n by traversing just the first half we can avoid redundant iteration and computations improving the efficiency of the algorithm.


Algorithm

Step 1: Initialise an array to store the divisors.

Step 2: Iterate from 1 to square root of n using a loop variable ‘i’. For each value of ‘i’:

Check if ‘i’ is a divisor of ‘n’ by checking if ‘n’ is divisible by ‘i’ without a remainder (‘n’%i == 0).
If i is a divisor, add it to the vectors of divisors.
If i is different from n/i add the counterpart divisor n/i to the vector of divisors.
Step 3: After the loop, return the array of divisors.

# Code
```java []
                                
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static ArrayList<Integer> findDivisors(int n) {
        // Initialize an empty
        // ArrayList to store the divisors
        ArrayList<Integer> divisors = new ArrayList<>();

        // Iterate up to the square
        // root of n to find divisors
        // Calculate the square root of n
        int sqrtN = (int) Math.sqrt(n);

        // Loop from 1 to the
        // square root of n
        for (int i = 1; i <= sqrtN; ++i) {
            // Check if i divides n
            // without leaving a remainder
            if (n % i == 0) {
                // Add divisor i to the list
                divisors.add(i);

                // Add the counterpart divisor
                // if it's different from i
                if (i != n / i) {
                    // Add the counterpart
                    // divisor to the list
                    divisors.add(n / i);
                }
            }
        }

        // Return the list of divisors
        return divisors;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 12;
        ArrayList<Integer> divisors = findDivisors(number);

        System.out.print("Divisors of " + number + " are: ");
        for (int divisor : divisors) {
            System.out.print(divisor + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();

# Factorials Less than or Equal to n (GFG)
Difficulty: Easy

A number n is called a factorial number if it is the factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
Given a number n, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to n.

### Examples:

Input: n = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 1 which is less than equal to n. The second number is 2 which is less than equal to n,but the third factorial number is 6 which is greater than n. So we print only 1 and 2.

Input: n = 6
Output: 1 2 6
Explanation: The first three factorial numbers are less than equal to n but the fourth factorial number 24 is greater than n. So we print only first three factorial numbers.

Constraints:
1<=n<=1018

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Long> factorialNumbers(long n) {
        ArrayList<Long> ans = new ArrayList<>();
